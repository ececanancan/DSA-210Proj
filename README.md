# DSA-210Proj

This project will be an analysis on my own screen time.
The dataset consists of personal screen time logs collected over one month. The data will include total screen time per day, breakdown of time spent on different activities such as entertainment,communication, financial by application categories. And I will categorize my data into periods like morning/evening,weekdays/weekends.

My project idea is to analyze personal screen time data to identify my habits, evaluate how time is spent across various activities, and explore potential improvements for digital well-being. The project aims to answer questions like: Are there peak screen usage times during the day?,What activities dominate my daily screen usage?,How does screen time align with my goals or tasks?

My plan is to collect screen time data with activity tracker in Ä°phone. Then extract my data and categorizing it for analysing deeply. The aim is to organize data into a structed format.
